            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>The Center for Inclusive Education Gender and Development was established with the primary purpose of providing free,
                appropriate, quality, and industry driven education to persons with disabilities and to those who are experiencing difficulties due
                to some personal preferences and reasons. The center allows LSENS to learn alongside with regular students without them being
                segregated or confined in a self-contained environment. With the merging of the Center for Gender and Development and Center or Inclusive Education,
                the thrust of making a difference for those who are different now makes more sense. In essence, this center ensures to
                capacitate every student to participate and take his/her role as a productive member of any society regardless of any personal or
                physical limitations, ethnicity, cultural background or other limitations brought about by their situations. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This center also
                guarantees that laws and policies concerning the rights and privileges of all students but not limited to the above mentioned
                sector are taken into consideration to address diversity, thus resulting to an inclusive and gender responsive and inclusive
                university and city. As mandated by the University of Makati, the vital goal of the center is the full mainstreaming of our
                graduates for functionality and independent living.Â </p>
