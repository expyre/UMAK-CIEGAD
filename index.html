                            Directed Immersion involves a collaborative effort among the training center, the college, and industry partners, beginning one semester before the scheduled on-the-job training. Job Coaches identify and outline the specific skills and competencies required for students to ensure their readiness and successful integration into the workplace. <br> <br>
                            This phase is designed to familiarize students with their future work environment while simultaneously preparing industries to address accessibility needs. Weekly meetings are held between students, center representatives, and Job Coaches to help students feel comfortable in their future training sites and to proactively address any potential concerns prior to deployment. <br> <br>
                            The team of coaches collaborates to refine course content with a strong focus on skills development and mastery, aiming for the ultimate goal of future employment for the students. <br> <br>
                            <p> <h1>GUIDED ON-THE-JOB TRAINING</h1>
                                Guided OJT involves close supervision and support from a designated OJT professor or coordinator, who regularly accompanies students to observe their adaptation to the workplace. Each visit includes the preparation of anecdotal reports that document student performance in areas such as skills acquisition, teamwork, socialization, adaptability, emotional and behavioral adjustments, functionality, and independence. <br> <br>
                                A scaffolding approach is employed to build students' self-esteem, self-reliance, and trust in their Job Coaches and industry personnel. Regular consultations with all stakeholders, including parents, are conducted to facilitate follow-up sessions at school and reinforce skills at home through face-to-face consultations. <br>
