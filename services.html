            <p> The City of Makati prioritizes the upliftment of persons with disabilities (PWDs) and their full integration into mainstream society as part of its developmental agenda. Development is inclusive and should benefit everyone, not just specific groups. With proper training and skills development, every individual can contribute to the city’s progress. <br> <br>
                By law, companies are required to allocate at least one percent (1%) of their workforce to PWDs. To encourage compliance, the City of Makati has enacted a city ordinance that provides incentives to companies that include PWDs in their workforce. <br> <br>
                For graduates who choose to reside outside of Makati, the city facilitates proper employment coordination through the local employment offices in the student’s area of residence. This ensures seamless support for graduates as they transition into the workforce. <br> <br>

                    <h1>INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT</h1>
                    <p> Educational provisions at the University of Makati (Umak) emphasize the belief that the general education curriculum is designed for all students. Inclusive education, therefore, should not be viewed as a separate program but as an integral part of a continuum of supportive services and programs. These services ensure that the general education environment is responsive to the diverse needs of all learners. <br> <br>
                        Given that UMak offers post-secondary education, it is essential for secondary schools to begin collecting data on students' academic performance, the interventions implemented, and the supports provided. This data will assist UMak in determining the most appropriate programs based on students’ knowledge and skills acquisition. <br> <br>
                        UMak’s support systems are continuously evolving, focusing on improving processes that enable teachers to collaborate and share expertise. This collaboration is vital in assisting students who face academic difficulties in accessing the curriculum, as well as those dealing with social and emotional challenges. The support system is designed with increasing levels of intervention, layering instructional support within the general education program. <br> <br>
                        Philosophically and practically, the system aims to assess each student’s needs, provide targeted interventions or supports, and measure progress or ongoing challenges. The success of inclusive education hinges on professional collaboration among team members, as well as an understanding of the student’s educational history and current needs. <br> <br>
                        Additionally, stakeholders directly involved with the student must be equipped with the knowledge to select and implement evidence-based interventions tailored to the student's specific needs. CIEGAD plays a crucial role by collecting formative assessment data, which documents intervention activities and student progress. This data serves as baseline information for profiling and guiding future interventions.cally and personally. <br> <br>
