                    <p>Persons with disabilities are given free access to higher education.  Students who are formally diagnosed or properly assessed to be having difficulties that limit their capacity to learn undertake the same university admission requirements with some additional processes like:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>a.  An applicant must be properly endorsed by his/her former school and must submit an academic performance report bearing information of interests, strengths, limitations and an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) if there is any, <br>
                        b. Medical assessment or evaluation if any, <br> 
                        c. Parent/s or guardian/s and the applicant must be interviewed by the center for profiling
                        d. After fulfilling all regular admission processes, another interview will be done by the Dean of the receiving college for program identification

                        This service involves triangulation of the center, the college, and industries that starts one semester before the scheduled on-the-job training.  Job Coaches lay down the skills and competencies required of our students to be accommodated.  This phase  is necessary for our students to be familiarized with their future environment and for the industry to prepare and be oriented to address accessibility.  Students and center representatives meet with Job Coaches once a week to make our students feel comfortable with their future training places and for the center to address in advance whatever concerns before the actual deployment.   The team of coaches  will work to redirect course contents  since our main goal is skills development and mastery with future employment as our ultimate hope. <br> <br>
                        <h2>b. Guided on-the-job training</h2>
                        This guided OJT means that a designated OJT professor or a designated coordinator  will regularly accompany our students to observe how well they cope up with their new environment.  Each visit will require individual anecdotal report to record performances in terms of skills, teamwork, socialization, adaptability, emotional and behavioral adjustments, functionality and independence.  Scaffolding will be used to foster self-esteem, self-reliance and trust towards their Job coaches and with the entire industry personnel.  Consultations with all concerned including parents will be done regularly for follow-up sessions to be done during face-to-face consultations in school and reinforcements at home.

                    <p>One of the developmental agenda of the City of Makati is the upliftment of the conditions of persons with disabilities and their full integration in a mainstreamed society.  The basic premise of development is not confined to a specific group of people, rather, development is for everybody.  With proper training and skills development, anyone can be an asset to a city’s progress.  By law, it is mandated that at least one percent (1%) of any company’s workforce should be dedicated to PWDs.  With this, to encourage companies,  the City of Makati came up with a city ordinance to incentivize companies who will be accommodating PWDs as part of their workforce.  For graduates who decide to live outside of Makati, proper employment coordination is done through the local employment offices of the locality in which the student is a resident of.</p>

                    <h1>Instructional Support</h1>
                    <p>Educational provisions reinforce the belief that general education curriculum is for each and every student. Therefore, inclusive education should not be a separate program, but rather should be one aspect of a continuum of supportive services and programs that are provided to ensure that the general education environment is a responsive one. On that end, considering that UMak offers post-secondary education, secondary schools must start developing an avenue for gathering data focusing on academic performance, implemented interventions and or supports provided to student.  Such data will help UMak in determining the best program considering all factors of knowledge and skills acquisition.   University of Makati’s systems of support is continuously developing and improving its processes that will help enable teachers to meet collaboratively to share their expertise with one another in order to assist students who are experiencing academic difficulties in accessing the curriculum or to those with social and emotional challenges. The system is designed with increasing levels of intervention layering the instructional support as part of the general education program. <br>
                        Philosophically and practically, it aims to assess a student's needs, provide interventions/support, and to measure the gains or continuing challenges the student may be having. The success of inclusive education depends upon professional collaboration among team members and knowledge of the student's educational history and current challenges. In addition, stakeholders directly involved with the student must have knowledge of how to select and correctly implement evidence-based interventions that are likely to address the student's identified needs. Finally, CIEGAD gathers and keeps formative assessment data that documents intervention activities and student progress. These data will then be used as baseline information for profiling and for future interventions.
